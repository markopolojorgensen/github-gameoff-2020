------------------------- TODO -------------------------
gravity well mode lets you delete gravity wells
  highight or otherwise indicate gravity wells that will be deleted
gravity well mode sfx
  meep merp if you're in a gravity well and try to enter gravity well placement mode
  ding when placing a gravity wells
  slurp when picking up a gravity well
more nasa images lul
jumping through one-way collision platforms shouldn't change animation
player shouldn't collide with one-way platforms from the side
player death animation & sfx
gravity wells should grey out during cooldown
if the player's in a gravity well immediately after cooldown, it should grab them
enemy death animation
Vector2(Vector2.RIGHT).normalized() == Vector2.RIGHT
camera should reset faster on death
player death sfx
player death art
gravity well spawn art
plunger should probably not be a rigid body
defeated enemies respawn on player death
editor options for which directions enemies go
limited number of wells per room
camera limits per room
camera hold still during jumps (maybe just vertically?)

boss fight:
  nemesis gets their hands on a resizing gun, makes giant enemy
  player resizes their gravity gun to comically oversized version
    shoots giant gravity wells to defeat giant enemy

moving platforms
  catch them in gravity wells for massive damage?

slight hover on floating island parts of level

picking up enemies
there-and-back movement

levels should be 1-3 minutes long
at least 3 platforms should be able to be seen on screen
jump height -> about a third of the screen
enemies promote movement
  usually at least one enemy on screen at a time
  often 3 or 4
sometimes there are "visual treats" in a level


individual rooms on the way in, one big room on the way out
one hit mario deaths
room limits for number of wells

multiple players bug?

gravity well momentum preservation
  slight decay
  indicated by flip animation speed in gravity well
  moon indicating direction

gravity well should spit player in direction they're holding, not direction the sprite's in

weaponized gravity well

progression:
  basic movement
    level design
      gravity well movement puzzles (just player at this point)
      cross pit / up to ledge
      "the drop" shoot well straight down

  weaponization / fun
    angry birds / physics bodies playground
  puzzleized weaponization
    smash through walls?
    hit out of reach buttons with enemies
      open a door, pull a lever, etc.
      use an enemy to hit an out of reach plunger
        escort level
    pile enemies on a scale
    bosses


focus to expand gravity wells, they shrink slowly while you're not concentrating


boss fight, constantly throwing enemies into the well and then throwing them all at the boss

--------------------- DEFUNCT IDEAS --------------------
gravity well is based on analog stick movement, flick the stick is all that is needed
