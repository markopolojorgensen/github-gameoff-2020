------------------------- TODO -------------------------
"gravity well placing mode"
more nasa images lul
clamp nasa images to db32
jumping through one-way collision platforms shouldn't change animation
player shouldn't collide with one-way platforms from the side
player: stick to the ground, please

------------------------- DONE -------------------------
player jump sfx
super mario world camera movement
one-way collision tilemap
player jump animation
player gravity-well-spin animation
player land sfx
player footstep sfx







levels should be 1-3 minutes long
at least 3 platforms should be able to be seen on screen
jump height -> about a third of the screen
enemies promote movement
  usually at least one enemy on screen at a time
  often 3 or 4
sometimes there are "visual treats" in a level


individual rooms on the way in, one big room on the way out
one hit mario deaths
room limits for number of wells

multiple players bug?

gravity well momentum preservation
  slight decay
  indicated by flip animation speed in gravity well
  moon indicating direction

gravity well should spit player in direction they're holding, not direction the sprite's in

weaponized gravity well

progression:
  basic movement
    level design
      gravity well movement puzzles (just player at this point)
      cross pit / up to ledge
      "the drop" shoot well straight down

  weaponization / fun
    angry birds / physics bodies playground
  puzzleized weaponization
    smash through walls?
    hit out of reach buttons with enemies
      open a door, pull a lever, etc.
      use an enemy to hit an out of reach plunger
        escort level
    pile enemies on a scale
    bosses


focus to expand gravity wells, they shrink slowly while you're not concentrating


boss fight, constantly throwing enemies into the well and then throwing them all at the boss


moon princess
  gravity gun
  orbital weapons

speed & flow, sonic the hedgehog style
bouncing off walls

--------------------- DEFUNCT IDEAS --------------------
gravity well is based on analog stick movement, flick the stick is all that is needed
