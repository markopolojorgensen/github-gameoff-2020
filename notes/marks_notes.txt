flipped enemies should be freed when resetting after player death

player should bounce off enemies and the plunger when jumping on them

gravity well mode polish
  camera limits should apply to gravity well mode as well
  no spawning gravity wells in the wall/floor
    meepmerp when trying
  prevent player from deleting the gravity well they're in
  ding when placing a gravity wells
  slurp when picking up a gravity well
  gravity well spawn art
  camera shouldn't wobble when leaving gravity well mode
  meep merp if you're in a gravity well and try to enter gravity well placement mode

gravity well polish
  if the player's in a gravity well immediately after cooldown, it should grab them
  gravity wells should grey out during cooldown

jumping through one-way collision platforms shouldn't change animation

player shouldn't collide with one-way platforms from the side

camera should reset faster on death

camera hold still during jumps (maybe just vertically?)

rooms
  clear all wells / restart room button
  switching to sonic camera mode on the way back
    moment of transition when pluging plunger needs to be fixed
  limited number of wells per room
  room transition sfx
  gravity well mode should also respect room limits
  arrows showing where transitions are

screen shake

wall of death

timer hud

gravity well player_in_well visibility trigger???
  gravity well dummy player

enemy polish
  animations

main menu shows total time per save file

camera shwoop between room camera limits

palette swap ground tileset for more level variants
  same for spikes, rocks

spikes should shatter when they hit the ground

spikes should shake when player in gravity well is close enough

dying after hitting the plunger should send you back to the plunger

player dance animation / celebration (fireworks?)

plunger should only plunge once

separate spawn positions in rooms once plunger is plunged

leaderboard???

ONLINE LEADERBOARD??????

actually get on the ship to start next level

ship flying away / landing per level

juice for flipping & kicking rocks

unbork & smooth out level transitions







------------------------- DONE -------------------------
different spawn points for players after plunger plunged
enemies get their own collision layer
enemies should start sleeping and wake up when player gets close
generic room scene to inherit from
you can re-enter a room after leaving it
camera limits per room
level manager
plunger should probably not be a rigid body
player death sfx
player death art
enemy death animation
you can now progress from one level to the next
spaceship
editor options for which directions enemies go
defeated enemies respawn on player death
gravity well mode lets you delete gravity wells
gravity well mode highights gravity wells that will be deleted
gravity well mode hum
player: stick to the ground, please
gravity well placement mode cursor
gravity well placement mode vignette
you can place gravity wells
clamp nasa images to db32? not ideal O_O
player jump sfx
super mario world camera movement
one-way collision tilemap
player jump animation
player gravity-well-spin animation
player land sfx
player footstep sfx






UNDERTALE?!?!?!?!

ship art
  captain art
  captain sfx
  tutorial island

arrow sign art


boss fight:
  nemesis gets their hands on a resizing gun, makes giant enemy
  player resizes their gravity gun to comically oversized version
    shoots giant gravity wells to defeat giant enemy

moving platforms
  catch them in gravity wells for massive damage?

slight hover on floating island parts of level

picking up enemies
there-and-back movement

levels should be 1-3 minutes long
at least 3 platforms should be able to be seen on screen
jump height -> about a third of the screen
enemies promote movement
  usually at least one enemy on screen at a time
  often 3 or 4
sometimes there are "visual treats" in a level


individual rooms on the way in, one big room on the way out
one hit mario deaths
room limits for number of wells

multiple players bug?

gravity well momentum preservation
  slight decay
  indicated by flip animation speed in gravity well
  moon indicating direction

gravity well should spit player in direction they're holding, not direction the sprite's in

weaponized gravity well

progression:
  basic movement
    level design
      gravity well movement puzzles (just player at this point)
      cross pit / up to ledge
      "the drop" shoot well straight down

  weaponization / fun
    angry birds / physics bodies playground
  puzzleized weaponization
    smash through walls?
    hit out of reach buttons with enemies
      open a door, pull a lever, etc.
      use an enemy to hit an out of reach plunger
        escort level
    pile enemies on a scale
    bosses


focus to expand gravity wells, they shrink slowly while you're not concentrating


boss fight, constantly throwing enemies into the well and then throwing them all at the boss


moon princess
  gravity gun
  orbital weapons

speed & flow, sonic the hedgehog style
bouncing off walls

player
enemies
  ground enemy
  floating enemy
level
mechanics
  charge / dash
  jump
  gravity gun
floating rocks

--------------------- DEFUNCT IDEAS --------------------
gravity well is based on analog stick movement, flick the stick is all that is needed
