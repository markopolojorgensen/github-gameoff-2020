Ideas
	Gravity orbital weapon
		Launched via triggers
		Fixed distance launch
		Shoot things into it
		Jump into it
		Analog stick direction/mouse out with jump button
		Preserves speed
		Indication that
		The gravity ball has friendly AOE to make it easier to pull objects in

	"Floating rocks"
		If the gravity gun is launched near them, they weaponize the rocks. Maybe other button and/or bumpers to launch

	Enemies
		Possessed Moon stones
		Prevent you from progressing if not dealt with
		Don't have to fight all them

		Floating enemies
			Can get stuck in the gravity ball and launched as well

	End of level
		Plunger that launches moon back into orbit
			rough homage to SMW
		Headcannon:
			if you don't defeat all enemies, they all just explode when the moon launches back

	Pick up and throw objects and/or carcasses?
		Moon rocks that just exist
	
	We are bouncy.

	Things we might need
		Moon launching gravity balls into the scene
		parallax

	Goal
		1 level.

	Pick a resolution
		16x9: 256x144

	Player
	Level
	Enemies
	Music
	Mechanics
	"Charge"
		Don't know how it works yet
	Jump
	Gravity Gun
		6 different thigns in one
	Floating rocks
	Floating enemy
	Possessed Rock

More than 1 level
	Different moon "levels"
		This is our water level
		Just jump and float forever
		Everyone will hate this.
		Best music in game for SURE.
		Semi-pivotal to teh storyline

	Moons from previous levels are in the background

	Solar System level select screen
		assuming we have more than one level?
