Princess: [frustrated] hrmmmm... stupid diplomatic mission... foreign moon, enemies everywhere...
Princess: [determined] I think they might be trying to get rid of me. I've got just the thing for this!

Princess: [pulls out gravity gun]

[fade to white, younger princess, outside, green pastures, weird insect cows in background]
[welcome to tutorial island]

Old Man: your father wouldn't want me to show you this... but, this is a gravity gun!
Old Man: It pulls things in and can launch them in a direction of your choosing.

[old man shoot gravity well into the sky]
Old Man: Pick up that rock, and throw it near the well.
Old Man: You can use the analog stick or mouse to pick a direction and press bumper (or B) to launch

[don't allow princess to jump yet, only pick up and throw]
[wait for completion]
[old man shoots another gravity well into the sky]

Old Man: [pleased] Very Good! Now if you want to have some real fun, try jumping into the well.

King: [pissed] SHE ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT. I will not have my daughter put in danger by the science advisor.
King: [pissed] She could've been killed.

[fade to white, back to the moon]
[level starts off with a rather simple jump that requires the princess to jump into it to get the required platform]
